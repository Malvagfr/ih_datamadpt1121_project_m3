# Kaggle Competition - Predict Diamond Prices 💎

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dataptmad1121/overview

## **🎯 Objectives:**
The goal of this project is the prediction of the price of diamonds based on the following characteristics:
- Carat: the weight 
- Dimensions (x,y,z)
- Table
- Depth
- Color
- Cut:
- Clarity: a lack of internal defects called inclusions

For doing this we will:

- This problem requires Supervised Learning as there is an expected output (i.e the diamond's price).
- Predicting the price of a diamond from dataset is a Regression Task. More specifically, a Multivariate Regression Task.
- We will be using the Batch Learning technique since the data is not live-fed from a source.
- The accuracy of the prediction is meassure using The Root Mean Square Error, RMSE (typical for Regression tasks).
